		<p>Even after all this time, I reminisce, still, about the most gruelling 10 days of my life I've never been in. One might wonder how could 'reminisce' and 'most gruelling' could be in the same sentence. Oxymoron indeed! It's been. It was one of those experiences where you feel you were torn to shreds emotionally every single second you've been in but would greatly miss and await for the next time to arrive for roller coaster the ride of emotions again.
		</p>
		<p>No! I'm not talking about the same feel you get while going back to school after a long and eventful summer vacation. It's neither the change of landscape that gives the urge nor the boredom of the present one. And not even the escape from the burden that is reality and enter into a fantasy realm no worries can hurt us. It's the infinite amount of undiscovered emotions inside that are waiting to be unearthed; waiting to be felt.</p>
		<p>It might sound overly vague but the truth is it can't be simply expressed in words. Without further ado, let me jump into the details of my first time visit into that amazing place.</p>

			<p>On day 10, the final technique in the course was taught. It is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mett%C4%81">Metta Bhavana</a> or Loving Kindness. After the session, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noble_Silence">Noble Silence</a> was broken and the goods were made available at the reception. This was the day where you can make a payback of what you learnt by donating money. Not compulsory though. A book exhibition conducted where you can find books on Buddha, Vipassana etc. The day was pretty much usual as there were slideshows about the various Vipassana Centers spanning across more than 40 countries around the world.</p>
			<p>We started talking to each other and everyone had instantly become attached as we kinda spent 10 days without talking and now that the entire curfew was lifted. Everyone was sharing their experiences and the sensations they came across the entire course. It was very good to talk to everyone as you would get the feel that you knew them already.</p>
			<p>Day 11 was very simple with 1 hour of discourse followed by 1 hour of meditation. And we all bid goodbye to each other promising to come back the same time next year. Return journey was a bit annoying as you have to walk half a kilometre to go to the nearest bus stop and the bus frequency was just 1 in half an hour. So, I again took a cab ride to reach home.</p>
			<p>A Roller Coaster Ride Indeed!</p>
