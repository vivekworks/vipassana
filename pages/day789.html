		<p>Even after all this time, I reminisce, still, about the most gruelling 10 days of my life I've never been in. One might wonder how could 'reminisce' and 'most gruelling' could be in the same sentence. Oxymoron indeed! It's been. It was one of those experiences where you feel you were torn to shreds emotionally every single second you've been in but would greatly miss and await for the next time to arrive for roller coaster the ride of emotions again.
		</p>
		<p>No! I'm not talking about the same feel you get while going back to school after a long and eventful summer vacation. It's neither the change of landscape that gives the urge nor the boredom of the present one. And not even the escape from the burden that is reality and enter into a fantasy realm no worries can hurt us. It's the infinite amount of undiscovered emotions inside that are waiting to be unearthed; waiting to be felt.</p>
		<p>It might sound overly vague but the truth is it can't be simply expressed in words. Without further ado, let me jump into the details of my first time visit into that amazing place.</p>

			<p>The next 3 days weren't as stressful as the previous ones. Day 7 was the one where each would be provided a cell in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pagoda">Pagoda</a>. Some would prefer meditating in the hall while others would be doing it in the Pagoda. The cell had nothing but a cushion and light bulb. Since the Dhamma Setu centre is located closer to the Airport, frequent noise from the aircrafts disturbed the meditation flow. So I preferred continuing in the hall.</p>
			<p>On 8th day, I started to feel very good. The meditation technique started provided some kinda unexplainable feeling all over the body. I learnt to ignore the pain and was very much involved in doing it. The feeling was very great. Some kinda liberation or the stress taken away from our head. On the next day, it was much more better. The meditation felt good and the complete calmness gave a sense of purpose in my life. You know how they say about we should listen to our own voice. Now I was able to hear that.</p>
			<p>The discourse continued to entertain and I always felt the necessity to attend it without fail. During the 9th day discourse, it was informed that the next day would be the one where the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noble_Silence">Noble Silence</a> would be broken and our stuff would be returned including our mobile phones.</p>
