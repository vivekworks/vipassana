		<p>Even after all this time, I reminisce, still, about the most gruelling 10 days of my life I've never been in. One might wonder how could 'reminisce' and 'most gruelling' could be in the same sentence. Oxymoron indeed! It's been. It was one of those experiences where you feel you were torn to shreds emotionally every single second you've been in but would greatly miss and await for the next time to arrive for roller coaster the ride of emotions again.
		</p>
		<p>No! I'm not talking about the same feel you get while going back to school after a long and eventful summer vacation. It's neither the change of landscape that gives the urge nor the boredom of the present one. And not even the escape from the burden that is reality and enter into a fantasy realm no worries can hurt us. It's the infinite amount of undiscovered emotions inside that are waiting to be unearthed; waiting to be felt.</p>
		<p>It might sound overly vague but the truth is it can't be simply expressed in words. Without further ado, let me jump into the details of my first time visit into that amazing place.</p>

			<p>Until that point of the course, everything was manageable. Even though it felt like a suffering, it was within the grasp our will. But Day 5 was the one that started a process called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adhi%E1%B9%AD%E1%B9%ADh%C4%81na">Adhitthana</a> which tested my will to the maximum for the next couple of days. The process simply means that until a session ends be it 1 hour or 2, body shouldn't go through any movements. It should lay still though it would go numb or the pain would become unbearable. That wasn't a compulsion but everyone practiced it, you would be in a position to do it else you might look like a failure.</p>
			<p>During the evening 1 hour session, I thought I would do it no matter what happens. <q>Boy! Was I so stupid?</q> considering what followed after that. Since it was my first time, I couldn't manage it more than 30 minutes and it started to give me extreme back pain, numbness and the pain caused due to numbness. A few minutes later, it felt like a nerve popped up on my forehead. I couldn't control the pain and whatever that is happening to me. Yet I finished the test with flying colours but with much of the energy and will completely drained.The discourse went okay that day and it wasn't particularly inspiring. That night in my sleep, I was bogged with lot of dreams and it almost felt like heavy traffic of thoughts and dream events.</p>
			<p>I woke up on day 6 completely irritated and easily annoyed. When I went to the morning 4.30 am session, I noticed that the guy who sat beside my seat wasn't there. I thought he might have feel sick or something. But only later I realized that, he actually left the place. That gave me an ultimate urge to quit owing to pain I suffered the previous day. I decided I can quit in the afternoon and packed my bags to leave the premises. After lunch, I was taking a walk pondering over the decision and the immediate ramifications I would have to face.</p>
			<p>Then it immediately occurred to me what kinda person I was. I was an absolute "quitter" until that point. Whenever I smell trouble, I would quit and move on to pursue something else. I would keep <q>No pain, no gain</q> as a status or my wallpaper but never have actually continued even in pain. Added to that, I was also thinking about the fact that when I informed my parents about the 10 day retreat, they never said anything against it. Now if I return in the middle, it would be like I let them down and their belief on me.</p>
			<p>There I decided. I was gonna see through that no matter what. Generated a lot of will on my own for the first time in my life that day.</p>
