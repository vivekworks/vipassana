		<p>Even after all this time, I reminisce, still, about the most gruelling 10 days of my life I've never been in. One might wonder how could 'reminisce' and 'most gruelling' could be in the same sentence. Oxymoron indeed! It's been. It was one of those experiences where you feel you were torn to shreds emotionally every single second you've been in but would greatly miss and await for the next time to arrive for roller coaster the ride of emotions again.
		</p>
		<p>No! I'm not talking about the same feel you get while going back to school after a long and eventful summer vacation. It's neither the change of landscape that gives the urge nor the boredom of the present one. And not even the escape from the burden that is reality and enter into a fantasy realm no worries can hurt us. It's the infinite amount of undiscovered emotions inside that are waiting to be unearthed; waiting to be felt.</p>
		<p>It might sound overly vague but the truth is it can't be simply expressed in words. Without further ado, let me jump into the details of my first time visit into that amazing place.</p>

			<p>A little background on how I came to know about the retreat. After finishing my X board examination, I was spending the 2 month long vacation playing with my friends. On a fortunate day, my school tamil teacher approached me about a meditation course for students which lasts for 1 and half days. Since, I didn't have much useful things to do, I agreed and accompanied him to this wonderful place. They taught us <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anapanasati">Anapana Sati</a>, which is a meditation practice involving paying attention to our breath. The course was good and I returned home and like every good student, completely forgot and never practiced it all.</p>

		<p>Just a mere coincidence or destiny, I happened to meet the same school teacher during November 2016 and he again informed me about the Vipassana Course for adults which I was already aware of but you know, who has the time for it? In the age of social media and netflix, <q>Ain't nobody got time for that</q>. Yet, I just wanted to give it a try to get to know whether I could live without those things. He also told me it would help me concentrate in whatever I do amidst all distractions. So, I thought, <q>Why not?</q>.</p>

		<p>I registered through <a target="_blank" href="https://www.dhamma.org/en/index">Dhamma Org</a> website a month before the course date and received the allotment confirmation through email. As for you know, the course is completely free of cost. Food and accommodation are free. But if you take some extra service like laundry, you have to pay a minimal cost. </p>
			<p>There are instructions on the website about how the course will be conducted and what are all the materials what we need to bring to be sufficient. As usual, I decided to skim through it and I went there totally unprepared. I know only the fact that mobile phones are not allowed. I looked over everyday timetable and even though it was challenging, I was up for it.</p>
			<p>One important thing that impressed me throughtout the entire course was that even though these are the teachings of Buddha, they made it clear that Buddha wasn't the founder of Buddhism and anyone who pursue this wouldn't needed to belong to any particular sect. Their belief was "All are humans" no matter what religion or sect they're from. The core ideals are very intact and impressive. As a proof, I came across people from 4 different religions during the course in that place.</p>
			<p>Go through the events that happened and my complete experience across those 10 days of stay chartered here. I've included all major points needed to be known before attending a retreat in any of the Dhamma Vipassana Centres.</p>
