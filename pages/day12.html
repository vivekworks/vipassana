		<p>Even after all this time, I reminisce, still, about the most gruelling 10 days of my life I've never been in. One might wonder how could 'reminisce' and 'most gruelling' could be in the same sentence. Oxymoron indeed! It's been. It was one of those experiences where you feel you were torn to shreds emotionally every single second you've been in but would greatly miss and await for the next time to arrive for roller coaster the ride of emotions again.
		</p>
		<p>No! I'm not talking about the same feel you get while going back to school after a long and eventful summer vacation. It's neither the change of landscape that gives the urge nor the boredom of the present one. And not even the escape from the burden that is reality and enter into a fantasy realm no worries can hurt us. It's the infinite amount of undiscovered emotions inside that are waiting to be unearthed; waiting to be felt.</p>
		<p>It might sound overly vague but the truth is it can't be simply expressed in words. Without further ado, let me jump into the details of my first time visit into that amazing place.</p>

			<p>The first 2 days went very smooth as I had small background in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anapanasati">Anapana Sati</a> technique. But it was really weird to have a roommate and not talk at all. Noble Silence meant no eye contact or nothing, so the silence started to get onto me.</p>
			<p>The morning wake up ritual at 4 am was making me a bit sick as I never did that in my life consciously. Added to the part that I was gonna do it for the next 10 days was kinda getting on my nerve. Never in my life have I ever had breakfast at 6.30 am in the morning. You've to be in the dining hall atleast before 7 am otherwise no one would be there to serve you the dish. The next meditation session would be at 8 am so we gotta an hour rest there which I spent sleeping almost everyday.</p>
			<p>The energy or the enthusiasm that I had while applying for the course slowly started to decline as the schedule was completely new as you would be spending more than 10 hours meditating. With no one to talk to, all you can do is enjoy the greenery of the place, watch the sunset perhaps and take walks on the pavement.</p>
			<p>The video recording discourse given by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S._N._Goenka">S.N. Goenka</a> played at the end of each day was very good as it explains clearly the day's training. We were taught about Sila, Samadhi and Panna. The discourse was available in different languages but only the english version was in the form of video taken during one of the sessions taught by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S._N._Goenka">Goenka</a> himself and other language versions were audio only and a mere translated version of the one in english. So, english version is always preferrable.</p>
			<p>Laundry service was available only on even numbered days and you'd have to pay for it at the end of the course.</p>
