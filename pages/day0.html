		<p>Even after all this time, I reminisce, still, about the most gruelling 10 days of my life I've never been in. One might wonder how could 'reminisce' and 'most gruelling' could be in the same sentence. Oxymoron indeed! It's been. It was one of those experiences where you feel you were torn to shreds emotionally every single second you've been in but would greatly miss and await for the next time to arrive for roller coaster the ride of emotions again.
		</p>
		<p>No! I'm not talking about the same feel you get while going back to school after a long and eventful summer vacation. It's neither the change of landscape that gives the urge nor the boredom of the present one. And not even the escape from the burden that is reality and enter into a fantasy realm no worries can hurt us. It's the infinite amount of undiscovered emotions inside that are waiting to be unearthed; waiting to be felt.</p>
		<p>It might sound overly vague but the truth is it can't be simply expressed in words. Without further ado, let me jump into the details of my first time visit into that amazing place.</p>

			<p>As per the email I received, I had to report to the Dhamma Setu centre between 2pm and 4pm. I took a cab ride to reach the place with a packed bag. As the instructions were clear, I didn't pack anything than necessary. There is an ample space to park vehicles and it is the best way to reach there if you have one.
		</p>
		<p>They provided an early dinner at 5pm(I know!) and we were all summonned at the dinner hall at 6pm to provide the course introduction and rules. I could see there a lot of people who vary across ages very eager in learning about the Vipassana Meditation technique. Even people from different countries gathered around there to learn it. I was even amazed by the fact that we Indians tend to ignore it whereas they were very much interested in our Spirituality. We were all allocated rooms with first time students and senior on different blocks. Each room has an attached bath and can accommodate two people. Ladies and Gents stay in different sections and would never meet them again for the next 9 days.</p>
		<p>One of the things that was stressed in the introductory session was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noble_Silence">Noble Silence</a>. No means of communication should happen among the students being it speech or gesture. Leave alone them, we were not even supposed to make eye contact with one another. I was completely taken aback by this as it is a difficult thing to do in this Age of Social Media.</p>
		<p>They also mentioned that the food would not have a particularly good taste as it would have less salt or spice. Two meals a day and a snack at 5pm would be provided. For seniors, instead of a snack, lemon juice should be consumed.</p>
		<p>After the introduction, we were all designated with a number and a seat in the Meditation Hall (Dhamma Hall), where my next 10 days were gonna be. On the same night, we were taught <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anapanasati">Anapana Sati</a> technique. The techniques were all taught by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S._N._Goenka">S.N. Goenka</a> through the audio recordings played in the hall. Even though the teachings were through audio played, there was a teacher who would meditate with us. He would clarify our doubts during the query session in the time schedule.</p>
