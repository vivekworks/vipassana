		<p>Even after all this time, I reminisce, still, about the most gruelling 10 days of my life I've never been in. One might wonder how could 'reminisce' and 'most gruelling' could be in the same sentence. Oxymoron indeed! It's been. It was one of those experiences where you feel you were torn to shreds emotionally every single second you've been in but would greatly miss and await for the next time to arrive for roller coaster the ride of emotions again.
		</p>
		<p>No! I'm not talking about the same feel you get while going back to school after a long and eventful summer vacation. It's neither the change of landscape that gives the urge nor the boredom of the present one. And not even the escape from the burden that is reality and enter into a fantasy realm no worries can hurt us. It's the infinite amount of undiscovered emotions inside that are waiting to be unearthed; waiting to be felt.</p>
		<p>It might sound overly vague but the truth is it can't be simply expressed in words. Without further ado, let me jump into the details of my first time visit into that amazing place.</p>

			<p>One noticeable change that started happening to me was that I started waking up even before the 4 am bell. And most importantly, since the 2nd day, I would always and almost immediately go into lucid dreaming during my sleep. The sleep would be eventful. Thoughts would be bombarding my head all at the sametime. That was super weird and difficult to explain. I thought of asking about it during the query session but never did.</p>
			<p>Day 3 was the day where the actual technique would be taught - Vipassana. It was a different technique than what you learnt for the first 2 days. It was different but not difficult. Since our mind couldn't be controlled to focus on a single point of reference, everything felt difficult during the initial days. Ever since the first day I was instructed that I can sit in any posture I liked. Only mandate was that our backbone should be straight.</p>
			<p>During the discourse on the 3rd day, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S._N._Goenka">Goenka</a> mentioned that any individual who comes to take up the course would either run away on the 2nd or the 6th day. I was wondering, <q>Why would anyone do that?</q>. But only later, I realised how much sense it made. Since I passed the 1st portion of the hurdle, I was very much confident that I would clear the 2nd portion as well i.e., 6th day.</p>
			<p>At that point of the course, I was getting tired of the 4 am schedule and I wasn't feeling any progress or experiencing any betterment in my mind of any sort. I didn't know that it was pure naiveity. But if you were going through such a strict schedule, you would wanna see some silver lining after all. And it was completely new to me.</p>
